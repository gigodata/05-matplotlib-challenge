# This analysis combines data from a recent animal study at Pymaceuticals, Inc.
# It combines mouse-specific data along with observations for several types of treatments
# Data are compiled and summarised to show the efficacy of each treatment and provides comparisons and 
# several graphs that provide data visualisation.

# The source code is contained in the repo found at: https://github.com/gigodata/05-matplotlib-challenge
# The filename is: pymaceuticals_final.ipynb
# I completed this exercise alone, without consulting others. AI was helpful in correcting
# erroneous code and to catch mistakes as the code was in development.
